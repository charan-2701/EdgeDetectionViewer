This is a placeholder for the OpenCV Android SDK. Download OpenCV Android SDK from https://opencv.org/releases/ and extract it here as `opencv`.

After extraction, import the `opencv/sdk/java` module in Android Studio and copy native `.so` files from `opencv/sdk/native/libs/` to `app/src/main/jniLibs/`.
